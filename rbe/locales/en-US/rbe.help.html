<h4>Block unless value changes</h4>
<p>Blocks all inputs which are equal to the last output.</p>

<h4>Block unless value change is greater or equal</h4>
<h4>Deadband</h4>
<p>Blocks all inputs which are smaller/smaller or equal to the last output or last input +/- the difference.</p>
<p>The difference can be a flat value like <code>42</code> or a percentage like <code>42%</code>. The difference is calculated from the last output or input.</p>
<p><code>This mode does NOT work with objects</code></p>
<h4>Block if value change is greater or equal</h4>
<h4>Narrowband</h4>
<p>Blocks all inputs which are in greater/greater or equal to the last output or last input +/- the differnce</p>
<p>The difference can be a flat value like <code>42</code> or a percentage like <code>42%</code>. The percentage is calculated from the last output or input.</p>
